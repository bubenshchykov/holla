Stability of video and sound communication are still the main focus of webRTC team

Rtc clients require "signaling server" for handshakes and meta-information exchange, so they can start a sweet peer-2-peer connection after. There are quite a few existing abstractions for it - webRTC.io, PeerJS, holla and other. I tried holla bacause it doesn't mess with multiple rooms and provides a sugar API for the client as well.
